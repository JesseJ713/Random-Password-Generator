### Project Status

The initial process I had in mind was a bit complex and after continued research, I had scrapped my initial template to pursue the what is now the final product. I am beginning to feel more comfortable with the concepts of the algorithms that support the program, but will need more practice in order to gain the confidence needed to begin projects such as these with the base knowledge of these particular algorithms.
